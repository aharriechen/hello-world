        "The application of AI quantitative investment in the financial industry is a general trend. It uses computer technology to select a variety of \"high probability\" events that can bring excess returns from the huge historical data to develop strategies, so as to avoid making irrational investment decisions when the market is extremely enthusiastic or pessimistic. For example, it is popular for investment firms to recommend clients buy gold and its derivatives to protect the value of their assets during the global economic downturn. Many large investment institutions choose to buy gold futures and spot gold. It is well known that the price of a commodity fluctuates around its value. Therefore, the purchase and sale price selection of goods is very important. The difference in the middle is the profit that people make. Because of the large amount of trading, the use of human labor to operate will cause loss of profits. Large international institutions use AI quantity system order to trade to avoid investment institutions making irrational investment decisions in the case of extreme emotions. So how to build an effective AI quantitative system framework in the field of gold investment is very important. This paper will discuss the validation of the data analysis model and its ethical consequences."

        "This article will mention the variable that affects the gold price, reduction of interest. When the bank reduce the interest rates, the return of saving funds in the bank will decrease, so the reduction of interest will lead to the outflow of funds from the bank, and the deposit will be changed into investment or consumption. As a result, the liquidity of funds will increase. For example, if the federal reserve announces to reduce interest rates, it means that the dollar will depreciate. As the dollar depreciates, investors will reduce their investment in the dollar and increase their investment in gold. An increase in the number and amount of money invested in gold will lead to a rise in the price of gold.\n",

It is known that in the market, buyers and sellers are playing a game of power all the time. The chart is a record of the results of this game. With the emergence of these classic patterns again and again, we can use the experience of learning patterns to simulate the future trend. This is morphological analysis. In fact, many hedge funds use graphic recognition to follow market trends. Funds such as man's AHL fund often use complex computer models built by teams of scientists to try to catch trends and other patterns. However, the limitation of this pattern is that the factors considered in analyzing the future situation through historical performance are not comprehensive enough, which often makes the test results differ greatly from the real results. As a result, many funds are gradually cutting back on the use of trend-following models.\n",
